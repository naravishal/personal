## Azure Data Engineering Technologies. 

### Azure SQL Database 

- It is a main Database Service provided by Azure 
- Iaas- Azure Database in virtual Machine
- Azure Database and Azure Datawarehouse is different
- Deployment types
    - Single Database
    - Elastic pool
    - Managed Instance
- It is Fully Managed Service
- Predictable Performance and Pricising
- Elastic Pool Enables pool of databases to share common resources
- High Availability
- Geo-Replication and Restore Services
- Two Options
    - IaaS ( SQL Server on Virtual Machine)
    - PaaS ( DB as Service)
        - Single Database
        - Elastic Pool
        - Managed Instance.
- Azure SQL Database is nothing but SQL Server running on Cloud.

### Azure SQL Data Warehouse

- Azure SQL Dataware house is basically SQL Server with Setting optimized for OLAP, ( Similar to Oracle being used as OLTP and OLAP with different setting)
- OLAP Support
- It is primarily used for Querying and Reporting
- Supports MPP ( Massing Parallel Processing)
- You can pause the virtual Service to save the cost
- Azure SQL Datawarehouse in very costly
- It supports Pollybase.
- Deployment modes similar to Azure SQL Database.
- Managed Instance ? is a deployment option of Azure providing near 100% Compatibility with latest SQL Server on-prem
- Migration Option 
    - Data Migration Service
    - Back and Restore.
- Service Tiers of Managed Instances
    - General Purpose ( Standard Edition)
    - Business Critical (Enterprise Edition)

### Azure Synapse Analytics

- Azure Synapse Analytics is a Cloud database provided by Azure.
- Supports MPP ( Massive Parallel Processing)
